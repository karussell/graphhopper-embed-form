# Embed GraphHopper Maps in your Website

Three simple steps:

 1. Copy and paste the html found in test.html
 2. Find out the coordinates of your address (necessary in step 3), For that go to [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/) right click on your location and click show coordinates
 3. Change points (1) and (2) in the copied code according to your needs. Now style the form to your own content and use more beautiful map layers like [Omniscale](http://maps.omniscale.com/en/)
  
Another simple method is to provide a link with an empty start point e.g. like

[https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=&point=berlin](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=&point=berlin) 

which zooms in the destination and allows the user to insert the destination directly on GraphHopper Maps.
